## Resources
* Data: New York CitiBike Dataset csv
* Tableau Public version 2021.4

## Project Overview
In an effort to establish a recreational bike-sharing program in Des Moines modeled on the success of Citi Bike in NYC, August 2019 trip data was analyzed to better understand how such a program might work in Iowa. Findings were consolidated into a story format, available at [Tableau - NYC CitiBike Challenge](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stephanie8808/viz/NYCCitibikeChallenge_16487439334420/NYCCitiBikeChallenge?publish=yes).

## Project Steps
*	Import data into Tableau.
*	Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
*	Use Tableau to demonstrate findings.

## Summary of Findings
With over 2 million bike trips completed in August 2019, bike usage appeared aligned with the NYC work week.

Because usage appeared specific to the traits of New York commercial life, two additional considers should include:
1. A heatmap of bike usage on the weekends specifically, when usage is more likely related to recreational use.
2. A comparison of time spent by customers (rather than subscribers) in comparison to destinations.

If these displays demonstrate infrequent users are plentiful enough to sustain a recreational program, Des Moines is in for some wheelie good fun.
